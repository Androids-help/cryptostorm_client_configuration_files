This is where you'll find the most up to date OpenVPN configs for cryptostorm.

```
When saving these config files, DO NOT USE right-click -> "Save file as" in your browser.
That will cause the HTML page listing the file to be saved, which will cause errors in OpenVPN.

Instead, click on the file you want to use, then click on "Raw", then save it.
```
You can also download the [master.zip](https://github.com/cryptostorm/cryptostorm_client_configuration_files/archive/master.zip) if you need all of these configs at once.
