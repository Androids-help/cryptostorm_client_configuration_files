This is the current productionlist of all member-accessible widget session profiles (aka geographic clusters) & balancers. It's not always a 1:1 reflection of the full suite of HAF-defined geographic node-clusters & network-wide balancers, but rather those that are available in the widget's pull-down profile selection menu.

Also... unicorns. Never turn your back on one. Trust me.
