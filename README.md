EDIT: added windows configs and rearranged the directory structure to be a little easier to navigate.
I added the UDP and TCP configs for windows, but I haven't added TCP configs for mac/linux yet. 
But you can connect to the linux/mac instances on TCP.
And yes, you can use any port to connect to any instance (including cryptofree).

...

this is the time in the show when we... config?

A still-being-populated place where our various client-side configuration files ("conf's") reside, to provide additional options for members seeking full sets for a given OS, or to create dynamic links via git/wget to specific data in the files themselves.

If the spirit moves you, feel free to fork and modify - push it back our way, and we'll merge if it's up to speed with the way things work. Note that there's 2.0 conf's in the early works, so if that's a thing to which you'd like to contribute, feel free to spin up a folder in here for 2.0 work and we'll synch our in-house notes and pre-production experimental parameters with your stub - good times!

Also... unicorns. Never turn your back on one. Trust me.
