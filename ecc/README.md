These configuration files are focused more on security than compatibility.
They work with OpenVPN 2.4.0 through 2.4.6, and OpenSSL 1.0.1d through 1.1.1
Like the [rsa](https://github.com/cryptostorm/cryptostorm_client_configuration_files/tree/master/rsa) configs, the level of security depends on the version of OpenVPN/OpenSSL you have.
The newer the version, the better the security.

`OpenVPN 2.4.x is required for the configs in this folder.`
For the ones in [ecc/ed25519/](https://github.com/cryptostorm/cryptostorm_client_configuration_files/tree/master/ecc/ed25519/) and [ecc/ed448/](https://github.com/cryptostorm/cryptostorm_client_configuration_files/tree/master/ecc/ed448/) you will need at least OpenVPN 2.4.3 AND [OpenSSL 1.1.1](https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1.tar.gz)

See [https://cryptostorm.is/new](https://cryptostorm.is/new) for more information.
